(1) TO UNPACK BNK FILES
- First, browse original BNK file by clicking the "..." icon, then, push "load" button.

  *Contents should appear in the list*

- Indicate Work Directory, that is directory where files will be extracted
- Unpack : extracts selected file into <Work Directory>\<Name of Bnk file>\*
OR
- Unpack all: extracts all files into <Work Directory>\<Name of Bnk file>\*.



(2) TO MODIFY/REPACK FILES IN BNK
- make sure original BNK has been loaded in the tool and contents unpacked to Work Directory
- make your changes to files into <Work Directory>\<Name of Bnk file>
- Repack button : 
  step 1. select Directory to be repacked, e.g. <Work Directory>\<Name of Bnk file>
  step 2. indicate name and location of Bnk file to be saved with new contents. Original BNK is NEVER altered for safety reasons.


Have fun!
